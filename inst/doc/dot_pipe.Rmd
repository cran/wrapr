The "dot pipe" is an operator with a very simple definition:

> &quot;a %.&gt;% b&quot; is to be treated as if the user had written &quot;{ . &lt;- a; b };&quot; with &quot;%.&gt;%&quot; being treated as left-associative. (there are &quot;.&quot; associated side-effects).

This is deliberately more regular than and  has considerably fewer corner cases than the `magrittr` pipe used by `dplyr`.

For example, the following all evaluate to the same (which is not the case for `magrittr::%>%`):

```{r pipe}
library("wrapr")

1 %.>% c(c(.))
1 %.>% { c(c(.)) }
```
